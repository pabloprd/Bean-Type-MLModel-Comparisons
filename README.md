# Machine Learning 345 Final Project. Bean type prediction based on features

# Introduction
My goal was to implement three machine learning algorithims on a dry bean dataset and compare the accuracy and time between them. The dataset was acquired from the UCI machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php (donated by Murat Koklu of Selcuk University). The data consisted of 13,611 beans of 7 different types: Seker, Dermason, Sira, Horoz, Barbunya, Bombay, and Cali. Each bean was photographed and measured in 16 different ways which made up the feature table. 12 of those features were dimensions (ConvexArea, Area, Perimeter, etc.) while 4 features were shape forms (roundness, solidity, Eccentricity, compactness.)

# Algorithims
Nearest-neighbors
Support Vector Machines
Neural Network

# Conclusions

The least efficient and accurate was the nearest neighbor algorithim

The most efficient was the neural network (time-wise)

The most accurate algorithim was the support vector machine. 

# Running it yourself
All visualizations and algorithims can be run with the code provided in the jupyter notebook as well as the data provided in the Dry bean Dataset 2 folder or the UCI machine learning repository link.
